### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - Data Mining for Health: Staking out the Ethical Territory of Digital Phenotyping  

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Martinez-Martin, N., Insel, T. R., Dagum, P., Greely, H. T., & Cho, M. K. (2018). Data Mining for Health: Staking out the Ethical Territory of Digital Phenotyping. NPJ digital medicine, 1(1), 1-5.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article describes the process and usage of digital phenotyping as a way to diagnose psychological disorders. It also addresses the unintended consequences that occur if the data is used by someone other than its intended recipient.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - As mentioned above, an ethical concern could occur if the data were to get into the wrong hands. The data collected often includes emails, texts and other personal information leading an increased risk of identification. For example, if an employer were to figure out that a potential employee had a mental illness, they might choose another candidate. Also, the methods in which this data are collected do not always follow standard psychiatric guidelines but, at the same time, are used to formulate formal diagnosis. There are many consequences that can come from receiving a“false” or inaccurate diagnosis. These can range from the patients believing they have the condition to the possibility of beginning an unnecessary medication.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data collected for digital phenotyping comes directly from users’ smartphones and mobile devices. Individuals’s pulse, behavioral traces, tapping, keyboard interactions, voice and speech are measured.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Once the data has been collected, it is analyzed to make incites about the individual. The conclusions focus on mental health diagnosis and can pick up on cognition, alertness and violent behavior. It can even be used to detect early forms of dementia and alzheimers.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - I believe that digital phenotyping is like a double edged sword. This new method of collecting data can allow researchers to obtain many more participants especially because so many people use their phones on a daily basis. Also, as mentioned above, these inferences can catch diseases earlier than typical lab procedures. However, if these conclusions get into the wrong hands, there would be a lot more unintended consequences. It would be beneficial if this data technique could be incorporated into profession therapy sessions as an additional tool rather than a stand alone diagnosis.



### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - Mining Social Media Data for Policing, the Ethical Way

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Bousquet, C. (2018). Mining Social Media Data for Policing, the Ethical Way. Data-Smart City Solutions.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article discusses the use of data mining on social media in order for police to detect criminal behavior before the actual crime occurs.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The issue with this method revolves around how and what type of this data is collected. For instance, how in depth will the individual be tracked? Will it just include keywords or will location data or demographics come into play. A significant issue surrounding police brutality and profiling already exists and may be invigorated by this new method of investigation. Finally, are the conclusions the police draw from these algorithms evidence or reason for a search warrant or arrest? Even though this form of analysis may seem more objective, the way in which the analysts interpret this data could be just as subjective. For example, if the analyst has a certain bias, they might decide to look for or put more emphasis on specific keywords.   

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data being collected includes information from social media posts focusing on keywords and images. They could, for instance, look for keyword strings such as “gun”, “fight” and “shoot”.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Often, the algorithms are developed by private contractors who take the data and look for trends like the one above. This information is used to narrow in on a target, obtain their location and issue a warrant or an arrest.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The primary party that would gain from this analysis would be the police. They would be able to take a proactive approach to solving a crime versus just reacting. This could prevent damage, violence and even tragedy instead of responding after the crime already happened. With that being said, those who are falsely accused or targeted for unethical reasons, will greatly suffer from this analysis. There have been many criminals who are innocent but spend years in prison or even end up on death row due. An equitable way to implement this analysis could be to have it performed by a consistent organization, not an outside source. Additionally, training would need to take place in order to minimize bias within the analysts.
